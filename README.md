# How To Use
Before using this, you need to prepare your image files first. Other video editors can probably also do it but with Vegas Pro, you can render the entire video as PNG files with transparency support. Alright, so on the first frame, make sure your image is taking up the entire width and height of the video. Then, animate it and stretch it around in whatever way you want. Once you're happy with it, render it as PNGs. My program basically auto crops the transparent bits so the end result is your video just resizing itself.

Next, open my program and give it the folder location of the image files and also the location of the original unedited video. It needs it in order to get the FPS and audio, since PNG files don't store those data.
